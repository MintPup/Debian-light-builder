This module builds a debian light system inspired by forum member saintless on the murga-linux forum.

The structure of this module should demonstrate the use of some techniques to modify the debian light build.
folder hooks.chroot contains scripts and actions which will be executed in the chroot jail.
includes.chroot contains all the files which are added directly.


Icewm is the window manager, Rox pinboard is used for wallpaper and desktop icons

I also added new Icon set, LaGADesk-Bluenight.
